They are text-to-text, decoder-only large language models, available in English, with open weights, pre-trained variants, and instruction-tuned variants. Gemma models are well-suited for a variety of text generation tasks, including question answering, summarization, and reasoning. Their relatively small size makes it possible to deploy them in environments with limited resources such as a laptop, desktop or your own cloud infrastructure, democratizing access to state of the art AI models and helping foster innovation for everyone."

      "Abstract: Cowpea mosaic virus (CPMV) has demonstrated superior immune stimulation and efficacy as an intratumoral immunotherapy, providing a strong argument for its clinical translation. One important consideration for any new drug candidate is the long-term stability of the drug and its formulation. Therefore, our lab has evaluated the physical stability and biological activity, that is, anti-tumor potency, of formulations of CPMV in buffer (with and without a sucrose preservative) in multiple temperature conditions ranging from ultralow freezers to a heated incubator over a period of 9 months. We found that non-refrigerated temperatures 37°C and room temperature quickly led to CPMV destabilization, as evidenced by significant protein and RNA degradation after just 1 week. Refrigerated storage at 4°C extended physical stability, though signs of particle breakage and RNA escape appeared after 6 and 9 months. CPMV stored in frozen conditions, including -20°C, -80°C, and liquid N<sub>2</sub>, remained intact and matched the characteristics of fresh CPMV throughout the duration of the study. The biological activity was evaluated using a murine dermal melanoma model, and efficacy followed the observed trends in physical stability: CPMV stored in refrigerated and warmer conditions exhibited decreased anti-tumor efficacy compared to freshly prepared formulations. Meanwhile, frozen-stored CPMV performed similarly to freshly purified CPMV, resulting in reduced tumor growth and extended survival. Data, therefore, indicates that CPMV stored long-term in cold or frozen conditions remains stable and efficacious, providing additional support to advance this powerful plant virus to translation.\n",

      "Abstract: Epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) remains the most lethal gynecological malignancy with limited treatment options. CD47 is a critical immune checkpoint for tumor immune evasion and has been targeted in various clinical trials. This study aimed to assess the impact of chemotherapy on CD47 expression in EOC in order to determine the potential and optimal timing of CD47-targeted therapy in ovarian cancer. We analyzed the expression of CD47 in ovarian cancer and the effect of chemotherapy on the expression of CD47 in ovarian cancer tissues. Furthermore, we investigated the effect of chemotherapy on the expression of CD47 in ovarian cancer cells.\n",

      "Abstract: Mitochondrial regulation plays a crucial role in cancer immunity in the tumor microenvironment (TME). Infiltrating immune cells, including T cells, natural killer (NK) cells, and macrophages, undergo mitochondrial metabolic reprogramming to survive the harsh conditions of the TME and enhance their antitumor activity. On the other hand, immunosuppressive cells like myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), regulatory T cells (Tregs), mast cells, and tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) rely on mitochondrial regulation to maintain their function as well. Additionally, mitochondrial regulation of cancer cells facilitates immune evasion and even hijacks mitochondria from immune cells to enhance their function. Recent studies suggest that targeting mitochondria can synergistically reduce cancer progression, especially when combined with traditional cancer therapies and immune checkpoint inhibitors. Many mitochondrial-targeting drugs are currently in clinical trials and have the potential to enhance the efficacy of immunotherapy. This mini review highlights the critical role of mitochondrial regulation in cancer immunity and provides lists of mitochondrial targeting drugs that have potential to enhance the efficacy of cancer immunotherapy.\n",

    "**Categories:**\n",
    "1. **New Symptom**: Use this category if the user describes symptoms they are currently experiencing, without asking a question about a symptom, disease, or medical condition in general. This is typically when the user is directly seeking help for their own health concerns (e.g., \"I have a sore throat and feel dizzy\" or \"I'm experiencing joint pain\").\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Clarification**: Use this category if the user asks for specific clarification on a medical topic, symptom, or term they don’t fully understand. This usually involves requests for explanation, interpretation, or more information about something specific (e.g., \"What does hypertension mean?\" or \"Can you clarify the side effects of this drug?\").\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **General Info Request**: Use this category if the user asks general medical questions, seeks information on diseases, or makes inquiries that do not involve their own symptoms. This includes questions about conditions, lifestyle advice, and preventive health measures (e.g., \"What causes diabetes?\" or \"How can I improve my immune system?\").\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Scientific Doubt**: Use this category for inquiries related to recent or advanced scientific research, experimental treatments, new technologies, or cutting-edge findings in the medical field. This typically involves complex or specialized questions (e.g., \"What are the latest developments in cancer immunotherapy?\" or \"How does CRISPR technology work in treating genetic diseases?\").\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Other**: Use this category for all other types of inquiries that do not fit the above categories. This may include conversational or off-topic messages, general greetings, or questions outside the medical domain (e.g., \"Hello, how are you?\" or \"Can you help me with a non-medical question?\").\n",
